****Classification
- Types of Packaging Products

    = Plastics Packaging - Plastics Packaging is used for packaging a variety of items i.e. fragile or non-perishable products. Plastics packaging materials are used to cover the plastic related materials or products. Most Plastics Packaging companies recycle waste or scrap plastic for re-use in their own facilities, and even offer alternatives. Without packing, these sophisticated goods with low shelf life will be easily affected by climatic conditions and eventually result in their malfunction or destruction. This packaging is done in such a way that no air or dust can sneak in and affect the goods.

    = Flexible Packaging - Flexible packaging can be made with flexible materials that can be packed, sealed and can retain the freshness of its content. Be it moulding the packages into a variety of shapes or preserving the flavor and safety of food or logistical aspects, all are covered under the flexible packaging. This is the major benefit that makes flexible packaging the first choice for food packaging. The package can last for a very long time; if it is stored in the right conditions. Flexible packaging is environmentally friendly as it uses less material and less wastages to make it.

    = Preservation Packaging - Preservation packaging includes both shrink wrapping and vacuum packaging, as well as other forms of packaging such as jar canning, aluminum cans, and other types of protective packages like egg cartons and milk jugs.
